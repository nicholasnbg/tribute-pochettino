            <h2>Early Days</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Mauricio Pochettino was born in a small town called Murphy, a few hours outside Rosaria in central Argentina.</li>
              <li>One winters night, Marcelo Beisla, an ambitious young coach of Newell Old Boys came knocking. The pair had attended a nearby youth tournament and had been tipped off about a promising player who was unable to attend. After taking a look at the young Mauricio, "They are the legs of a footballer!" Beisla exlaimed...(not wierd at all right?)</li>
              <li>Beisla signed Pochettino there and then!</li>

            <h2>The Sheriff of Murphy</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Pochettino (aged 22) joined Espanyol in 1994.</li>
              <li>Pochettino would go on to make over 300 appearances, in 2 spells at Espanyol, becoming a club legend.</li>
              <li>Pochettino and Beisla were reunited soon after at Espanyol, with Beisla initially serving up some tough love,
                telling Mauricio that his last season "had been shit", and  if he played like that again,
                 Pochettino would never play in Beisla's team, and never play for Argentina!<br>Pochettino drove home in tears, but the harsh words inspired him.</li>
              <li>Inbetween his stints at Espanyol, Pochettino spent four years plying his trade in France, for PSG & Bordeaux.</li>
              <li>It was in France, that Pochettino first decided he would like to be a coach one day.<!-- Light bulb icon? --></li>
